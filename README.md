# Android-Click-Away-Application  
In this project, we created an android app as an e-shop for a coffee shop. Users can create an account, see the available products, create a list of favorites, add items to their cart and create a virtual order.  
In the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, this app traces the user's current GPS location and allows them to pick up their order based on their proximity to five specific shop locations in the area of Attica, Greece.  
This app uses a real time database thus every transactions for a specific user as long as their personal data is stored and managed in this database. Products' availability changes accordingly for every of the aforementioned stores. Extended attention was paid on UI design as well as app functionality.  
The app was created using Android Studio (API level 26 - Oreo 8.0). The user authentication as long as the database where implemented using Google Firebase.
